New Folder created As NewNeidoFatty in the wamp>www folder. 
Another folder called Resources created where i can add all the functions and developing part of my website.
Restricted the folder with .htaccess file where I said DENY all to the visitors who want to access the backhand resources.
Then I can created a Function folder to add functions only.
Other classes apart from joint functions are kept seperetely outside the functions folder.
Created one class file call Dbconnect.php which will only check and connect to the database of the server.
Created another php file nfsite_config.php which is includes all the connection of the functions and the objects of the class files.
